## What is Coinnect?

Coinnect finds the cheapest path to send money between any two currencies — across traditional remittance services, crypto exchanges, and regional P2P platforms.

You tell it where money needs to go. It tells you how to get there, ranked by cost and time. It never touches your funds.

```
GET https://coinnect.bot/v1/quote?from=USD&to=NGN&amount=500
```

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "label": "Cheapest",
      "total_cost_pct": 1.4,
      "total_time_minutes": 60,
      "steps": [
        { "from": "USD", "to": "USDC", "via": "Kraken",      "fee_pct": 0.5 },
        { "from": "USDC", "to": "NGN",  "via": "Yellow Card", "fee_pct": 0.9 }
      ],
      "you_send": 500.00,
      "they_receive": 762450,
      "vs_western_union_saving_usd": 21.50
    }
  ]
}
```

## Why mission-driven?

Every comparison platform faces the same problem: the business model eventually compromises the product. Affiliate commissions, promoted listings, premium placements — these introduce bias into what should be a purely informational service.

Coinnect accepts no commission from any exchange, ever. It is an open-source social enterprise, API-funded and supported by voluntary donations from users who save money using it.

## For humans and machines

**Humans** use the web interface at [coinnect.bot](https://coinnect.bot): enter amount, origin, destination — get ranked routes with step-by-step instructions.

**Machines** query the public REST API directly. Designed to be called as a tool by AI agents, chatbots, and automated systems. Full OpenAPI spec at [`/docs`](https://coinnect.bot/docs).

**AI agents via MCP** — ships with a native MCP server:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `coinnect_quote` | Find cheapest/fastest routes between any two currencies |
| `coinnect_corridors` | List supported currency pairs |
| `coinnect_explain_route` | Natural language explanation of a route |

```bash
python -m coinnect.mcp_server
```
